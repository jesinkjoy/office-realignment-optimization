# ðŸ§© Office Realignment Optimization

This project focuses on optimizing office space allocation across regions to minimize travel hours and operational costs. It involves transitioning from Excel Solver models to structured AMPL-based optimization. 

---

## ðŸ§  Objectives

- Optimize assignment of employees to regional offices using linear programming.
- Minimize commuting hours and total cost while meeting operational constraints.
- Transition from spreadsheet-based modeling to scalable programmatic optimization in AMPL.

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Methodology

- **Phase I**: Built a basic optimization model using Excel Solver to allocate employees based on commute hours.
- **Phase II**: Used AMPL to develop a scalable, structured optimization model based on regional capacity, cost constraints, and role-based availability.
- **Data Preparation**: Created detailed region-store mappings and aggregated cost/time assumptions to support modeling.
