# ðŸ§© Office Realignment Optimization

This project focuses on optimizing office space allocation to minimize commuting time and improve operational efficiency using Excel Solver and AMPL. 

---

## ðŸ§  Objectives

- Optimize employee-to-office assignments by minimizing total travel hours and associated costs.
- Develop structured models using Excel Solver (Phase I) and AMPL (Phase II).
- Apply linear programming techniques to improve decision-making in facility planning.

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Methodology

- **Phase I**: Created a basic optimization model using Excel Solver to assign employees to nearby offices based on travel hours.
- **Phase II**: Developed a structured linear programming model in AMPL, using cleaned and normalized data inputs.
- **Modeling Focus**: Incorporated constraints like availability limits and cost efficiency to produce an optimal realignment strategy.
